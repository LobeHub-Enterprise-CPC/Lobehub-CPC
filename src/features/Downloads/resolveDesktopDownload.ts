 * Three cases, and the third is the one worth spelling out:
 *
 * 1. The deployment publishes its own installers → its platform `/downloads`.
 * 2. Upstream, publishing none of its own → the hosted downloads page, which is
 *    that build's own site. Unchanged behaviour.
 * 3. A rebranded build publishing none → **nothing**. Falling through to the
 *    hosted page there sends users to a different product's installer, which is
 *    how these entry points became dead ends in the first place; a distribution
 *    that has not configured its downloads should show no offer rather than a
 *    wrong one.
 *
 * Case 1 is decided by server config rather than a compiled-in constant, so
 * moving the release hosting is an env change and a restart.
